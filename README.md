### Hi there, I am [Abdul Hannan Kanji](https://abdulhannan.in)ðŸ‘‹ . 
I am a Masters student at University of Massachusetts Amherst currently working on the [COVID-19 forecast hub](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub) developed at the [Reich Lab](https://reichlab.io) in UMass Amherst. I am also developing a library to train safe machine learning models in my [seldonian-fairness](https://github.com/hannanabdul55/seldonian-fairness) repository.  

I have a ["hobby" repository](https://github.com/hannanabdul55/neural-nets-research-playground) where I have various miscellaneous notebooks that I work on sometimes.
